                We all wanna make a place in this world. We all want our voices to be heard. Everyone wants a chance to be someone. We all have dreams we need to dream. Sweeter than any star
                you can reach. When you reach and find you've found someone. You'll hold this world's most priceless thing. The greatest gift this life can bring. When you look back and know
                you were loved.
